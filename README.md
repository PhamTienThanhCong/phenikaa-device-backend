## FastAPI Project - Backend

### Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher is required. Ensure that your environment is configured to use the correct version.
- **Python Package and Environment Management**: It's recommended to use `venv` or `conda` for creating isolated environments.
- **MySQL**: Ensure that MySQL is installed and properly configured for your project.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - It's crucial to work within a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can refer to this [guide](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for more details.

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   $ .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all the required packages are installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory to manage your environment-specific variables, such as database credentials.

   ```bash
   DB_HOST=your_db_host
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   ```

4. **Starting the Application**:
   - Start the FastAPI application using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ fastapi dev app/main.py
   ```

   - You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

5. **Running Tests**:
   - Ensure that your test suite is functioning properly before deployment. Run tests using:

   ```bash
   $ pytest app/tests/
   ```

6. **Database Migrations**:
   - If you have database migrations (e.g., using Alembic), apply them using:

   ```bash
   $ alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - When deploying your FastAPI application in a production environment, ensure that you configure the application for production settings:

   ```bash
   $ fastapi main app/main.py
   ```

   - Ensure to configure environment variables securely on your production server.

2. **Docker Deployment (Optional)**:
   - If you decide to containerize your application for easier deployment, consider using Docker:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.10-slim

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY . /app

   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   CMD ["fastapi", "main", "app/main.py"]
   ```

   ```bash
   # Build and run the Docker container
   $ docker build -t fastapi-app .
   $ docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
   ```

### VS Code Integration

- **Debugging**:
  - The project is pre-configured for debugging in VS Code. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables directly in the editor.

- **Running Tests**:
  - Tests can be run and managed within VS Code using the Python Test Explorer. Ensure that your `pytest` settings are correctly configured in your `settings.json` file.

- **Linting and Formatting**:
  - Ensure that `pylint` and `black` are set up for code linting and formatting. This helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### Additional Resources

- **Documentation**: Leverage the FastAPI documentation at [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for more advanced features and configurations.
- **Community Support**: Engage with the FastAPI community for support, best practices, and updates.
